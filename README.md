# How to read my repository
1. utils: includes helper functions
2. script: includes file runs (main files)
3. models: includes all algorithms 
    * single_solution: 
    * multiple_solution: 4 folders
        * human_based
        * physics_based
        * swarm_based
        * evolutionary_based
4. How to run?
    * run files in script folder, your environment need 2 package: copy and numpy
    * also change the parameters of models in scripts's file

# Notes
* This repository includes all optimization algorithms coded in python (Numpy) in my research time
